# CH552 Universal Macropad

This is a PlatformIO build of the existing CH55xDuino sketch. The source stays in
`CH552_Universal_Macropad.ino`, and the USB HID code stays under `src/`.

Install PlatformIO Core and the CH55xDuino Arduino Boards Manager package
version **0.0.25**. The build uses that package's SDCC toolchain
(`build.13407_4`) and MCS51 tools (`2023.10.10`). On macOS it is normally
installed under `~/Library/Arduino15/packages/CH55xDuino`. If yours is
elsewhere, set `CH55XDUINO_PACKAGE_DIR` to the package directory.

Run `pio run` to build. The output is `.pio/build/ch552/firmware.hex`.
To flash over USB, put the CH552 into bootloader mode and run
`pio run -t upload`. The sketch can enter the bootloader by holding the
encoder button for three seconds, or by holding the first three keys during
startup.

`platformio.ini` matches the Arduino settings: CH552 Board, 24 MHz internal
clock at 5 V, user USB code with 148 bytes reserved, and P3.6 (D+) pull-up
bootloader configuration. The project-local `pio-platform/` adapter is needed
because PlatformIO does not supply this CH55xDuino Arduino core as a standard
framework. The build and upload scripts currently target macOS, matching the
installed Arduino tool package.
